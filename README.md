# StocksPerformance
Binary prediction of stock performance using financial/accounting KPI's, on a dirty dataset

US-stocks.csv dataset contains ﬁnancial indicators for the stocks of the US stock market in 2018. The last column of the dataset represents the class of each stock: if the price variation of the stock for the year is positive, then class=1; 0 otherwise.

In this exercise I explore this dataset, and compare diﬀerent classiﬁcation methods.
